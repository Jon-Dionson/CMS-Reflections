Learning Activities 
This week, I looked into some aspects for creating custom themes (about less than half) for WordPress sites with underscores and learning DRY development for WordPress sites. In addition to the previous topics, I had also done a learning experiment where I would see if my work environment can determine how productive I can become.

# Content Insights 
With creating custom themes using underscores, I learnt that it is a big undertaking creating a theme; but with the use of underscores makes this slightly less daunting, as it acts as a launching pad. The LinkedIn course also led me to some test data. The use of this test data enables developers to check if their theme can take any situation into account. Without the use of the test data, ensuring that the theme is robust would be a difficult task. There are also useful plugins to aid with the creation of themes. The difference between child themes and custom/ parent themes is that custom themes are indented for the whole site and can be changed relatively easily, where as child themes are used for specific customisation within a WordPress site and the changes won't be lost when updating the parent theme.

I have heard of the DRY principle in previous programming subjects, so this idea is not new to me, but it is interesting to see how DRY is used in terms of developing and maintaining a website. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

## Employability Insights 
Having a strong understanding of themes in WordPress site is a valuable skill as it can give the developer tools to create themes that are specific to a client's request and can easily make edits to pre-existing themes with minor setbacks 


## Learning Insights
With the learning experiment, I found that when I was working in the university library I was able to be productive (productive as in being able to take in the content and writing down notes) than I was at home. This could be due to having less distractions around me, having other people work around me causing me to act more productive and that it was easier to get into "the zone" of studying. Where as when I was working from my home, my mind tends to lose focus much faster, took longer to get in "the zone" and there are more opportunities to get distracted.
