# Learning Activities 
This week was about the introduction of learning sass, which stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. This also includes learning how to use and set up gulp for automation, and enabling scss to be transformed into css files so that html can read it.

# Content Insights 
Sass is a very powerful tool within web development. Since css lacks variables, nesting and functions, this means css goes against DRY (don't repeat yourself). Sass makes it so that  css is much more modular follows DRY and makes the code easier to read. The use of gulp is also great tool as it enables developers to see their edits with greater ease with the use of browser sync, and enables scss files to be turned into CSS files (which html files can only read).

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

## Employability Insights
Being able to use sass will be a great help with web developers. This is cause it enables css files to be managed with great ease, less dificulty when making minor changes such as colour and enables developers to focus on more important things in web development such as JavaScript or site layout, instead of checking if they changed all the colours in the correct places or all the font is the same. 

## Learning Insights
For me, one of the biggest hurdles I had when working on this prac was setting up automation. This was most likely cause there no real explanation on why files are setup the way that they are. Since file setup is not mentioned, I figured that I only needed the files and not have the same setup. It was only until I followed how their files were setup I got the automation to work. Another learning insight I has was that there was not a lot of code within 'styles.scss',  it is just a lines of import statements. With this, it enables the code to be ingested much more easily, since each aspect of css will be seperated into different files, not in one gigantic block of text.
