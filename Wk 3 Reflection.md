## Content Insights
The accessibility and availability of getting free hosting for domains is getting more difficult. This is most likely due to crypto mining and bots. The whole prac class spent a good amount of time researching on hosting platforms without having to spend some amount of money. 

Also in this prac, we conducted several interviews. With these interviews, the class asked questions and wrote down notes on each person we interviewed. 

### Questions asked

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

One learning insight I had was that there are many ways to setup wordpress. Due to this, it can be very difficult for someone's who's utilising it for the first time and could leave them potentially lost without external help.
