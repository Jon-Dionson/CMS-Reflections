## Content Insights
Creating php websites has several challenges. As there is a lot more that needs to be set up in order to create php site. These include having a webserver in order to preview the files, creating said webserver, and getting an interpreter for php. This can be somewhat be made easier with xampp, but there are many different ways in creating a php site. 


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
A learning insight that I had during this prac was that I had great difficulty with figuring out to utilise some of the requirements since I greatly struggled on what to create for the prac. Another learning insight I had was that I could use the exercise files from the linkedin learning courses in order to help me learn php.
